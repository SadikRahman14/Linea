## DevNote
This was my first project after learning React ([ApproachReactJS](https://github.com/SadikRahman14/Nexora)) and Backend ([Nexora](https://github.com/SadikRahman14/ApproachReactJS)) development. Tried to focus on **double/multiple users** instead of **admin and user system**


- What I learned:
    - Socket.io was new to me
    - First time using zustand
    - Implemented file sharing functionality
    - Channel management features added
    - Deep Pipelines in MongoDB
